There's so many things I wanna tell you, and even then it'll not be enough to tell you how stewpidly I love you. The past year and some change, has definitely been the best and brightest times in my life, and there's no doubt in my mind that it's because you're in it. Meeting you, getting to know you and falling in love with you have undoubtedly been the biggest achievements I've ever achieved.
